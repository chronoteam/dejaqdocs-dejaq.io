## DejaQ

DejaQ is a distributed messaging queue built for high-throughput persistent messages that have an arbitrary or time-based order. It allows a point-to-point scheduled message-oriented async communication for loosely coupled systems in time and space.

The first paper/design will be soon made available. We are looking for main contributors, for more details please contact us on adrian@coder.today
